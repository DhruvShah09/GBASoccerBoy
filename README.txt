Hey there! Welcome to my basic soccer game! 

At initialization of the game you will see my splash screen representing my video game corporation (a.k.a. me!), after which you
will be directed to the introducion screen. Press start at the introduction screen to begin the game.

The game consists of a player (you), the defender (the computer), and a ball, as well as a playing field. Use the arrow keys to direct
the cyan ball into goal located at the top of the screen (denoted in gray). However, be careful, as you will lose a life if the defender
touches the ball, although he moves at random so it shouldn't be too difficult of a task. Once you score 3 goals, you win, but if you lose 
your 3 lives, you lose. 

That's all, make sure to have fun!
